# Nested-Object
We have a nested object. We would like a function where we pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

      This code will first define a function called get_value(). 
      The get_value() function takes two arguments: the object and the key. 
      The function then recursively checks if the key exists in the object. 
      If the key exists, the function returns the value of the key. 
      If the key does not exist, the function returns None.

    The main() function then prints the value of the nested object given the key. 

The execution of the code will print the value of the nested object given the key.
